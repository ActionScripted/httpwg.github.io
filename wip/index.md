Our current projects under development include:

### HTTP/2

This specification describes an optimized expression of the syntax of
the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  HTTP/2 enables a more
efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of
latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple
concurrent messages on the same connection.  It also introduces
unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients.

This document is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/
1.1 message syntax.  HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.

* [Working Group Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-http2) (less recent, more official)

### Header Compression (HPACK)

This specification defines HPACK, a compression format for
efficiently representing HTTP header fields in the context of HTTP/2.

### Alternative Services

This document specifies "alternative services" for HTTP, which allow
an origin's resources to be authoritatively available at a separate
network location, possibly accessed with a different protocol
configuration.

### Opportunistic Security for HTTP

This describes how "http" URIs can be accessed using Transport Layer
Security (TLS) to mitigate pervasive monitoring attacks.
